# Smart Agriculture Monitoring System (Python Project)

## Overview
This is a Python based Smart Agriculture Monitoring System developed as a university project. The system allows users to manage farmers, technicians, agricultural tasks, observations and financial records in an organized way.

**It supports:**
* GUI based interface (Tkinter)
* File handling for persistent data storage
* Object-Oriented Programming structure

## Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **OOP** (Object-Oriented Programming)
* **Tkinter** (GUI)
* **Pillow** (Image handling)
* **Pickle** (File storage)
* **OS Module**

## Features
* Add/View/Remove farmers and technicians
* Create, manage and assign tasks
* Mark tasks as completed
* Add farmer observations and financial transactions
* Calculate total revenue

## What I Learned
* Applying OOP concepts in a real project
* Building GUI applications using Tkinter
* Handling files using Pickle
* Managing structured data in Python

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Install Pillow library: 
   pip install pillow
3. Run the program for Graphical interface (GUI) :
   python GUI.py
4. Run the program for text based :
   python TextBasedCodes.py

**Notes:** All data is stored locally using Pickle. Duplicate IDs are prevented for better data integrity.
